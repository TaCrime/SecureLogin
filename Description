1. The project 'Secure login' is trying to follow  requirements:

Functional requirements:

 Anonymous users may register by creating a user account from the login page
 A user account consists of a login name and a password
 The password of an account is required to be strong
 Users that login with a valid login name and password are authenticated
 Only authenticated users may view the “Hello World!” dummy page
 Visual strength indicator while setting up the password using Ajax
The algorithm is so complex and business critical that it must be performed server side.
Non-functional requirements:
 Provide a readme file
Make application compile and run with up to three command line commands. Hint words: Maven2, Jetty, H2, and HSQL.
 Provide a description of the project structure and the decisions made
 Store the account settings in a SQL database using Hibernate
 Store passwords securely
 Multiple browser support
 Use valid XHTML and CSS
 Provide unit tests using JUnit
 Use the principles of test driven development
 Provide the solution as a Maven project
 Intuitive user interface

2. To start the project go to project folder and run
>> mvn jetty:run
(you should have maven installed and M2_HOME set :)))))
In browser open url <serverName>:8080

3. The project contains client and server parts which are communicating through servlets;
This type of communication was selected as most popularly used for generating dynamic content
on the Web and have native support for HTTP. (c)
The server side contains servlets which are using services. Services provides (attempt to) business logic.
JPA provider hibernate as most popular;
Server: Jetty. DB: hsql. Build manager: apache;
4. Solutions:
- Authentication is verified through session attribute "login" which is set after credentials verification.
If trying to open "Hello World" page without session or this attribute set user is redirected to login page;
- In addition to requirements the registration of the user with existing login is permitted, although developer
was not determined enough to give  login column UNIQUE constraint.
